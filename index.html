    Hi, I'm <b>Gabriele Pappalardo</b> (a.k.a. @gabryon or @gabryon99)! I'm <b>21</b> years old.
    I'm a Computer Science Student at <a href='#'>University of Pisa</a> and a UI developer and UX Designer at <a class="ntop" href="https://ntop.org"><b>ntop</b></a><br>
    On this personal blog I'm going to note things that I like (pretty much Computer Science stuff) and I'll use it
    as little portfolio for the people who doesn't know me. I would like to become a Videogame Developer since videogames
    are my passion. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Feel free to see my <b>Github</b> page.
</p>
