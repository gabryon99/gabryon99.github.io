                Hi, I'm <b>Gabriele Pappalardo</b> (a.k.a. @gabryon / @gabryon99)! I'm <b id="year">24</b> years old.
                I'm a Master Computer Science student @ <a href='#'>University of Pisa</a> and an Exchange Student @ <a href="https://www.cit.tum.de/cit/startseite/">TUM</a>. 
                Currently, I am a <b>Software Developer Intern</b> @ <a href="https://jetbrains.com">JetBrains</a>, and I am working on a Verification Framework for 
                the <b class='kotlin'>Kotlin</b> programming language using the <a alt="Viper Verification Infrastructure" href="https://viper.ethz.ch/">Viper Verification Infrastructure</a>.<br><br> 

                In October 2023 I discussed my master thesis at TUM. The master thesis was made in collaboration with JetBrains. The thesis title is <b>Extending Kotling with Algebraic Effect Handlers</b>: we are trying
                to understand if the <b class='kotlin'>Kotlin</b> programming language has room for algebraic effect handlers. We have a small library prototype showing the feasibility of the project, for more information click <a href="https://github.com/gabryon9/kotlin-effects">here</a>.
                I obtained my <b>BSc in Computer Science</b> in October 2021 (in Pisa) with my thesis entitled 
                    <b>Improving the support for 3D scanned data in MeshLab and PyMeshLab</b>, implementing the support for new file formats and plugins in Python (see the section below).<br><br>
                
                On this personal blog, I'm going to note things I like (pretty much Computer Science stuff) and I'll use it
                as a little portfolio for the people who don't know me. I love <b>computers</b> and <b>game consoles</b> and usually, I try to discover how they work under the hood. I have a passion about <b>programming languages</b> and their implementation.

                <i>Master's Thesis</i>: <a href="https://github.com/gabryon99/kotlin-effects/blob/main/docs/thesis.pdf">Extending Kotlin with Algebraic Effect Handlers</a>
                <b>Abstract</b>: In recent years, <b>Algebraic Effect Handlers</b> have emerged as new computational models to manage computation effects in programming languages. This model is linked to the area of functional programming languages. 
                The thesis will illustrate how it is possible to adapt algebraic effect handlers into the multiparadigm Kotlin programming language through the implementation of a library over continuations. 
                This master thesis is the result of a collaboration with JetBrains Research, which provided valuable insights and support in implementing algebraic effect handlers in Kotlin.

                <i>Review Paper</i>:<b>A Comprehensive Review of Kotlin Coroutines</b><br>
                <b>Abstract</b>: Asynchronous programming is a technique highly in use during the last decade. The need for responsive applications, with high throughput and low-latency, has never been so important as it is today. 
                Following this trend, mainstream programming languages, such as C++, Rust, Java, Go, Swift; have introduced features to enable asynchronous programming. 
                However, these constructs may not be immediate to the programmer. The following paper will focus on the Kotlin programming language, 
                and its pragmatic approach to asynchronous programming, with the use of coroutines and their modeling through structured concurrency. 
                In addition, we will explore how the Kotlin compiler compiles down coroutines in JVM bytecode, using a <b>continuation-passing style (CPS)</b>
                compilation with <b>finite state machines</b>.

                        (conceptually speaking). This JIT compiler implementation uses the C++ programming language. The

                <i>Bachelor <b>Thesis</b></i>: <a href="/assets/pdf/Thesis___Pappalardo___MeshLab.pdf">Improving the support for 3D scanned data in MeshLab and
                    PyMeshLab</a>.<br>
                <b>Abstract</b>: MeshLab, and its Python counterpart PyMeshLab, have been widely used for processing 3D scanned
                data. However, some functionalities of MeshLab that are entirely interactive have not been transferred
                into
                the scriptable framework under Python. Moreover, an emerging file format for distributing scanned data
                still
                is not supported by MeshLab.
                In this thesis, we have improved the capability of MeshLab to handle different kinds of 3D scanned data
                by
                adding the support for 3D scanned LIDAR data (E57). Moreover, by refactoring the core part of the
                alignment
                tools, we allowed higher flexibility in their usage in MeshLab and made them available in PyMeshLab.
