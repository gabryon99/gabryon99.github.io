        Hi, I'm <b>Gabriele Pappalardo</b> (a.k.a. @gabryon or @gabryon99)! I'm <b id="year">22</b> years old.
        I'm a Computer Science Student at <a href='#'>University of Pisa</a> and I worked as UI developer and UX Designer at <a
            class="ntop" href="https://ntop.org"><b>ntop</b></a>.
        On this personal blog, I'm going to note things I like (pretty much Computer Science stuff) and I'll use it
        as a little portfolio for the people who don't know me. I would like to become a Game Developer, since video games are my passion. I really like
        <b>computers</b> and <b>game consoles</b> and usually, I try to discover how they work under the hood. I have a passion about <b>programming languages</b> and their implementation.

                        <b>Abstract</b>: This presentation illustrates a brief history about JIT compilers and how they are implemented
                (conceptually speaking). This JIT compiler implementation uses the C++ programming language. The
                presentation was made for "Advanced Programming" colleagues (<i>English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§</i>)

                <i>Bachelor <b>Thesis</b></i>: <a href="/assets/pdf/Thesis___Pappalardo___MeshLab.pdf">Improving the support for 3D scanned data in MeshLab and
                    PyMeshLab</a>.<br>
                <b>Abstract</b>: MeshLab, and its Python counterpart PyMeshLab, have been widely used for processing 3D scanned
                data. However, some functionalities of MeshLab that are entirely interactive have not been transferred
                into
                the scriptable framework under Python. Moreover, an emerging file format for distributing scanned data
                still
                is not supported by MeshLab.
                In this thesis, we have improved the capability of MeshLab to handle different kinds of 3D scanned data
                by
                adding the support for 3D scanned LIDAR data (E57). Moreover, by refactoring the core part of the
                alignment
                tools, we allowed higher flexibility in their usage in MeshLab and made them available in PyMeshLab.
