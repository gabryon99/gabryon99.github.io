Hi everybody! I'm *Gabriele Pappalardo* (a.k.a. [**gabryon99**](http://github.com/gabryon99) on the web), I'm an almost 20 years old
italian guy who is studying right now at Pisa IT Department University.
I thought to create a game and in this blog I will share with you my ideas
about it.

The game's name is: **Light Pink** (or *Usubeni*, I have to think about the name lol). It is
a *not-RPG* game inspired by [**Undertale**](https://undertale.com/), [**To The Moon**](https://freebirdgames.com/to_the_moon/), [**Finding Paradise**](https://freebirdgames.com/finding-paradise/), [**Pokemon Mistery Dungeon Series**](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Mystery_Dungeon_series) and from [**The Legend Of Zelda Series**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda).
I say *not-RPG* because the game is a RPG game but it has few elements about RPG genres. I know that doesn't make any sense, but don't worry, I will
clear it up soon with some posts!

## Plot

The game plot is a merge about two japan legends:
* [Red Thread of Destiny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_thread_of_fate) 
* [Sakura's Legend](https://exploringyourmind.com/the-legend-of-sakura-true-love-story/)

You are a young boy/girl/whatever that must save the world from an evil force (*oh wow, that was unexpected*) that is taking apart
the couples and you have to defeat your **fears** in an ultimate battle to free them. But the journey is long
and maybe all the things won't work out as you expected.
